A custom texture packer I'm building for my game project written in Rust.

- [ ] Importing Tiled `.tsj` tilesets
- [ ] Ability to add custom meta data to sprites
- [ ] Ability to apply image effects to sprites
- [ ] Creating texture atlases using `rectangle-pack`
- [ ] Exporting everything in a JSON format
